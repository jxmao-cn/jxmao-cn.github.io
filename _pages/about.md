Hi, I’m Junxiang Mao, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at Soochow University. 
In September 2025, I was admitted via direct admission—without an entrance examination—into the Computer Science College of Zhejiang University. Starting next year, I will be joining the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University to pursue a direct doctoral degree under the supervision of Prof. [Kun Zhou](http://kunzhou.net/). My research interests lie primarily in **3D reconstruction and computer graphics**.
