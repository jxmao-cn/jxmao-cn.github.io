Hi, I’m Junxiang Mao, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at Soochow University. In September 2025, I was admitted via direct admission—without an entrance examination—into the Computer Science College of Zhejiang University. Starting next year, I will be joining the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University to pursue a direct doctoral degree. My research interests lie primarily in 3D reconstruction and computer graphics.  

More information will be released soon!
